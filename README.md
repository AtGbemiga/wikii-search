# Wikii Search

This app is based on the Wikipedia API that provides search results. The app returns a list containing the search result on a dynamic page. Users can read a summary of their search right on the app and view an associated image if available then read the whole story on Wikipedia. If no result is found, the user is notified.

The technologies used are: Next js, Typescript, CSS and [more](https://github.com/AtGbemiga/wikii-search/blob/main/package.json)

\* Performance is tied to the Wikipedia API which is limited. Learn more about the API [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
